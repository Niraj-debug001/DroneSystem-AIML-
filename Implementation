1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Problem and Dataset

Collect or use an existing dataset of images/videos containing people with helmets and without helmets (industrial sites, construction zones, or road traffic).

Label the images with bounding boxes and class labels: Helmet and No Helmet.

Split into training, validation, and test sets.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training (AI/ML Core)

YOLOv8 is ideal because it‚Äôs optimized for real-time detection.

Install ultralytics in Python:

pip install ultralytics


Train Custom Model:

Create a YOLO dataset structure (images/train, images/val, labels/train, labels/val).

Train with:

yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640


This produces best.pt which is your custom-trained model.

3Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI Backend (Real-Time API)

Create a Python FastAPI app to expose detection as an API endpoint:

Accept image or video input.

Run YOLO inference.

Return annotated image/video and detection metadata (confidence scores, bounding boxes, helmet status).

from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = YOLO("best.pt")

@app.post("/detect/")
async def detect(file: UploadFile):
    contents = await file.read()
    npimg = np.frombuffer(contents, np.uint8)
    frame = cv2.imdecode(npimg, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    results = model(frame)
    annotated = results[0].plot()  # annotated frame
    # Save or return as needed
    return {"detections": results[0].boxes.data.tolist()}

4Ô∏è‚É£ Video Processing Pipeline

Use OpenCV to read each frame from a video stream or drone camera feed.

Pass frames to YOLO model for detection.

Draw bounding boxes and save processed video with detections.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Digital Twin Logging (Data Layer)

For each detection, log the following into a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL):

Timestamp, GPS/location (if from a drone), object class (helmet/no helmet), confidence score, image frame link.

This creates a structured data stream for building a digital twin of the environment (historical trends, compliance patterns, predictive analytics).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Autonomous Decision-Making

Based on detections, trigger automated actions:

Alert systems (sound alarms, notifications).

Drone behavior (hover, follow, or record based on no-helmet detection).

Implement simple rules or reinforcement learning if complex decision-making is needed.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment with Docker

Containerize your FastAPI + YOLO model using Docker:

Write a Dockerfile installing Python, dependencies, and copying your model.

Build and run containers for consistent deployment.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Optional Enhancements (AI/ML Add-ons)

Use Edge AI to run YOLO on Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi on the drone itself.

Add streamlit or a dashboard to visualize real-time detections and compliance trends.

Integrate MQTT or Kafka for streaming detections to IoT systems.
